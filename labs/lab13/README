======================================================================

(This lab is collaborative, so feel free to work with friends or TAs.)

Objective: To begin coding in recursive assembly
"In order to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion"

You can find an appendix of basic assembly instructions on Canvas under:
   Files > Assembly Resources > PattPatelAppA.pdf

================
Your Assignment:
================

We have provided you with a skeleton assembly file called "fibonacci.asm".

Edit this file and turn in to gradescope

PseudoCode:
int fibonacci(int n) 
{ 
   if (n <= 1) 
      return n; 
   return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2); 
} 

    To Debug:
	a) load the fibonacci.asm file in complx
	b) Debug -> Simulate Subroutine and hit fibonacci
	c) Step through via complx!
